# Job Application Manager - Simplified

Similar to my Job Application Manager application but much more simplified. Less input required on the part of the user for a more stream line experience. This is a .NET application written in C# that helps users manage and keep track of the jobs that they have or are in the process of applying for. It allows them to keep all of the information for the company, the position, and the application in one place, while allowing them to make unique notes and journal their opinions about the position. For instance, they can note if their level of interest in the position and note whether they would be a good fit. The main idea is to use the app to have a brief overview of the position to refresh your memory about the details during communciations with that company and track your progress throughout your job search. 

As of 04/01/2024, this is currently a work in progress and changes will be made regularly.
